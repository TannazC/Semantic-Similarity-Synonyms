Semantic Similarity Synonyms is an AI-powered system that determines word similarity using semantic descriptor vectors and cosine similarity. The program is designed to answer TOEFL-style synonym questions and achieves up to 70% accuracy through natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Features:

    Constructs semantic descriptors using word co-occurrence in large text datasets.
    Computes cosine similarity to measure closeness between words.
    Uses sparse dictionary representation for efficient memory usage.
    Simulates TOEFL synonym test accuracy.

Skills & Concepts Used:

    Python and NLP
    Algorithmic text processing
    Cosine similarity and vector mathematics
    Dictionary-based data storage
    
How to Run:

    Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-similarity.git
      cd semantic-similarity
    Run the program:
      python synonyms.py

Future Enhancements:

    Word2Vec or transformer-based embeddings
    Larger dataset training for improved accuracy
    Interactive command-line synonym testing
